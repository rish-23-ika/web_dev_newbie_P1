Welcome to my web development journey! This repository showcases my first HTML and CSS project, CatPhotoApp, built as part of my learning adventure with FreeCodeCamp. I'm a newbie to web development, and this project demonstrates my understanding of basic HTML structure, CSS styling, and responsive design principles. Huge thanks to FreeCodeCamp for providing an amazing platform to learn and grow. I'm excited to share my progress and learn from the community.
